            which was concerning, and it
            didn't appear that it had been cleaned in months. The green tree air-freshener hanging from the rearview
            mirror was either exhausted of its scent or not strong enough to overcome the other odors emitting from the
            cab. The correct decision, in this case, was to get the hell out of it and to call another cab, but she was
            late and didn't have a choice.
